## JSON column notes

Postgres validates json, but there is no native schema validation support for nested json fields and datatypes. Relating JSON data is also problematic. Lesson-wise, this could lead into the topic of 'Normalization' and relations, and maybe some talk about "anti-patterns" using json in a relational db.
